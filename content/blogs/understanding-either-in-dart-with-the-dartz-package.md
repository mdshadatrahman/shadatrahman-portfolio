# Understanding Either in Dart with the DartZ Package

When dealing with complex code, handling errors and multiple possible outcomes can become challenging. This is where the `Either` class from the DartZ package comes into play. The `Either` class allows developers to manage operations that could yield one of two possible types: a success type or a failure type. In this blog, we will explore the significance of the `Either` class, its benefits, and how to use it effectively.

## Why Use Either?

### 1. Clear Error Handling:
   `Either` enables clear and explicit error handling in Dart. It forces developers to handle both success and error scenarios explicitly, leading to more robust and reliable code.

### 2. Stronger Type Safety:
   With `Either`, developers can enforce strong type safety, ensuring that the success and failure types are explicitly defined and handled, reducing the possibility of runtime errors.

### 3. Improved Code Readability:
   By explicitly defining success and error cases, code readability improves significantly. It becomes easier for other developers to understand the possible outcomes and potential errors at a glance.

### 4. Comprehensive Error Messaging:
   `Either` allows developers to attach detailed error messages or additional context to error types, providing comprehensive insights into the nature of errors, facilitating efficient debugging and issue resolution.

### 5. Seamless Error Propagation:
   The `Either` class makes error propagation seamless, enabling developers to pass errors through the call stack without losing crucial information about the nature of the error.

## How to Use Either in Dart

### Installation:
   Before using the `Either` class, you need to add the DartZ package to your project. You can do this by hitting the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   dart pub add dartz
   ```
   or
   ```
   flutter pub add dartz
   ```


### Basic Usage:
Here is a simple example to illustrate how to use the `Either` class in Dart:

```dart
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

Either<String, int> divide(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return Left('Cannot divide by zero');
  } else {
    return Right(a ~/ b);
  }
}

void main() {
  final result1 = divide(10, 5);
  result1.fold(
    (error) => print('Error: $error'),
    (value) => print('Result: $value'),
  );

  final result2 = divide(10, 0);
  result2.fold(
    (error) => print('Error: $error'),
    (value) => print('Result: $value'),
  );
}
